        <p class="lead mb-4">A focused and enthusiastic freshman majoring in Psychology at the University of California, Riverside, with great exposure to leadership, arts, and community engagement. Such a unique constellation of experiences reflects only a commitment to growth and professionalism while striving to make a difference in the field of psychiatry.


In this respect, during the last year and a half, I have been working in the church where I acquired a good interpersonal skill and sense of community psychodynamics. The position required not only to perform some office work but also take part in various programs enabling me to get in touch with different kinds of people. The experience I had in the setting taught me to be more empathetic and to communicate better, which is an integral part of being a psychiatrist in the future.

<br><br>
At high school, my artistic involvement was founding and leading an a cappella group. In this position, I got to work with my peers-build camaraderie and cooperation among them. I rehearsed and performed with the group, learning the values of dedication and the beauty of creating something special together. It further cemented my love of music as a powerful unifying and expressive medium and instilled even more drive in me to combine the arts into my future career.

<br><br>
Outside of my musical endeavors, I have acted as a vocal director for a middle school musical, mentoring younger performers and helping them hone their talents. Besides this, it also helped me reinforce my belief in the power of mentorship and encouragement through strengthened leadership skills. Working with students is something that drives passion and aligns perfectly with my goal of becoming a psychiatrist, helping others realize their potentials.

<br><br>
I am a native of Irvine, California, and have fostered my appreciation for music through self-taught learning on the guitar and furthered that education on the piano. Music is not simply a hobby; it is an important part of my life that nurtures my creativity and emotional well-being. The arts generally, and music in particular, play a very important part in mental health, and that is something I will most definitely take an interest in and implement into the therapeutic practices of my career.

<br><br>
I pride myself on being hardworking and a quick learner, qualities that have helped me both in my academic pursuits and out of the classroom. Of course, having to balance my studies with my commitments in the arts taught me the importance of time management and perseverance. I am particularly excited about furthering my education here at UC Riverside by continuing my interests in psychological studies and research that will lead me to my ultimate goal of focusing on psychiatry.

<br><br>
With a strong foundation in the arts, commitment to community service, and a passion for mental health, I am proud to enter the field of psychiatry. My effort will be to integrate my love for music into my aspiration to help others for a holistic approach toward mental well-being. I look forward to the opportunities ahead as I go forth in making a difference in the lives I touch.<br><br>
